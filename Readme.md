# CPP Module 03 - Inheritance

## üöÄ Introduction

This module is part of the C++ Piscine at 42 School. It introduces the powerful concept of **inheritance** in object-oriented programming (OOP). The goal is to understand how classes can derive from other classes, how to extend functionality, and how to properly manage object construction, destruction, and behavior chaining.

## üéØ Goals of the Module

- Understand **inheritance** in C++
- Learn how to use base classes and derived classes
- Master constructor/destructor chaining
- Apply the **Orthodox Canonical Form** with inheritance
- Understand how derived classes extend or override base class functionalities
- Handle class-specific behaviors while maintaining proper memory management

## üìö Exercise Summary

| Exercise | Description                                                                          | Key Concepts                              |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **ex00** | Implement the class `ClapTrap` with basic actions: `attack`, `takeDamage`, `beRepaired`. | Class basics, member functions, canonical form |
| **ex01** | Create `ScavTrap` class inheriting from `ClapTrap`. Add `guardGate()` mode.         | Simple inheritance, constructor chaining   |
| **ex02** | Implement `FragTrap` inheriting from `ClapTrap`. Add `highFivesGuys()` special ability. | Multiple child classes, extending functionality |
| **ex03** | Demonstrate proper use of destructors with pointers and references to base class.   | Virtual destructors, runtime behavior      |

## üóùÔ∏è Key Concepts Table

| Concept                  | Description                                                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance**          | Mechanism for a class to inherit members from another class.          |
| **Constructor Chaining** | When a child class calls the parent‚Äôs constructor to initialize base attributes. |
| **Destructor Order**     | Child destructors run before parent destructors (reverse of construction). |
| **Orthodox Canonical Form** | Constructor, Copy Constructor, Copy Assignment Operator, Destructor. |
| **Method Overriding**    | A derived class can redefine a method of the base class.              |
| **Virtual Destructor**   | Ensures correct destruction order when deleting via a base class pointer. |
| **Access Specifiers**    | `protected` allows derived classes to access members (unlike `private`). |
